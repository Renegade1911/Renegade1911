- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Gregory Dedicke. 
- Iâ€™m a current developer in C#, Javascript, Vue.JS, Python, HTML, and CSS.

Most of the projects in my repositories are side projects I've found online or in books, and I follow along to better my coding skills. For those reading this, I hope this demonstrates my coding aptitude. Or at the very least, my ability to follow instructions. Currently, I'm working as a Software Engineer in Beast Code. I'm always learning and working to be better!

- ðŸ“« You can reach me at greg.dedicke@gmail.com or call me at (307)631-4311
