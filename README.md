- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Gregory Dedicke
- Iâ€™m currently learning Python, HTML, CSS

Most of the projects in my repositories are side projects I've found online or in books, and I follow along to better my coding skills. 
For those reading this, I hope this demonstrates my coding aptitude!
Granted, I'm always learning and working to be better!
