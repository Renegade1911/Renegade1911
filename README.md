- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Gregory Dedicke. 
- Iâ€™m currently learning Python, HTML, and CSS.

Most of the projects in my repositories are side projects I've found online or in books, and I follow along to better my coding skills. For those reading this, I hope this demonstrates my coding aptitude. Or at the very least, my ability to follow instructions. Currently, I'm working to go to school for Computer Science at UCF for 2022. However, I will jump at any opportunity to learn on the job. I'm always learning and working to be better!

- ðŸ“« You can reach me at greg.dedicke@gmail.com or call me at (307)631-4311
